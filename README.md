# Feature-Selection-Improvement-in-ML-Based-Breast-Tumor-Classification
Improving different classification models in various machine learning based algorithms that classify breast tumors by introducing feature extraction.

1) Kaggle dataset located at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

The following feature selection algorithms are used to improve classification performance:
• Pearson correlation
• Recursive feature elimination
• Random forest

2) Various sampling methods are then used to improve the classification performance:
• Random undersampling
• Random oversampling
• SMOTE
• ADASYN
• A-SUWO
